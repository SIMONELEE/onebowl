   <h1>How We Started</h1>
   <p>One bowl had a very humble start, as a Sunday tradition with a group of friends. They would come together and eat food every week, and share about their lives. Sometimes people would bring friends, and some weeks they were up to 20 people.  Here some of their friends would share about their lives and their struggles and their need for community. We learn that for some of our friends had struggles with having enough money for food, and relied on these dinners. This started a conversation about community, food security and how we could make a safe space for all people no matter their circumstances or social backgrounds.
<br>Therefore, we begin this journey of One Bowl; making a difference One Bowl at a time.</p>

  	<p>Food Insecurity is defined “access to food is limited by a lack of money and other ressources at times during the year.” Food Insecurity might not be the first thing you think of when you think of a city like Copenhagen. But with growing cost of living, and other social cutbacks, many people are facing more and more insecurity, at times through the year on how they will get fresh, quality food on the table. </p>
