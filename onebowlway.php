		  <div class="col-sm-6">
			<p class="type">One bowl had a very humble start as a Sunday tradition with a group of friends. They would come together and eat food every week - and share stories about their lives. Sometimes people would bring friends, and some weeks they were up to 20 people. At these dinners, some of their friends would share their lives, their struggles and their need for community. We learned that some of our friends had struggles with having enough money for food, and relied on these Sunday dinners. This started a conversation about community, food insecurity and how we could make a safe space for all people, no matter their circumstances or social backgrounds.
			<br>
			Therefore, we begin this journey of One Bowl.  Making a difference One bowl at a time.</p>

			<p class="type">Food Insecurity is defined as: “access to food is limited by a lack of money and other ressources at times during the year.” Food Insecurity might not be the first thing you think of when you think of a city like Copenhagen - but with growing cost of living, and other social cutbacks, many people are facing more and more insecurity, at times through the year on how they will get fresh, quality food on the table. </p>

			<p class="type">Come as you are and pay as you feel. Meals are offered as a ‘pay as you feel’ basis in order to ensure a proper meal to everyone, regardless of one’s situation. This means there are no set prices on any food at One Bowl. We provide a suggested donation amount for our menu, to help you understand the cost of “paying it forward” and how to help those who struggle with food insecurity. Everything you give over the suggested price, goes to help others and to continue the work of One Bowl.</p>
