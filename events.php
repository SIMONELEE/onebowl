				<p>What is Street Bowl? That’s the time when we jump on our One Bowl’s cargo bike and share food all around the city. It happens in different time and different places in Copenhagen, but you can definitely see as from far away. We have smiling faces, a lot of great people around and a bike full of food to give. 
				<br>
				Sometimes we are serving to people on Dronning Louise Bro, and other times we partner with some really cool other organizations and serve for up to 400 people.  It’s One Bowl on the move.

				What is not to like?</p>

				<p>For the last 2 years One Bowl has partner with Regen(Link)  and Grace (Link) in their annually Distortation Party.  Here we get our dance moves on and try to make a difference.  Distortion is an annual party-tsunami over Copenhagen that happens every spring, with over 100 dancefloors on beautiful squares.  
				<br>
				One Bowl has a booth and sells indian street food, and has a party with a purpose with all our friends in Nørrebro.  Come Dance, and Celebrate Community together- And of course “Pay as you feel”</p>
