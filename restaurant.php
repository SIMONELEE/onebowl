	   <h1>Restaurant</h1>
	   <p>One Bowl is community restaurant open for everyone where we focus on food insecurity and helping each other. We are open every second week on Wednesday, but we hoping to expand and share food every week. 
Our dream is to have cozy outdoor café with open garden where we can grow our own, organic vegetables and welcome our guests on a sunny day. We know it sounds ambitious, but we believe that together we can make it happened. 
Come as you are and join us in the Ansgardskirken, because beating loneliness is just One Bowl away. 
<br><br>
The restaurant is also the main place where we build One Bowl community. For more updates find us on Social Media <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1bowl/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/onebowl.dk/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p>

	   <h1>Menu</h1>
	   <p>We want to include everyone at our table, that is why we cook vegan and vegetarian food. Every time our fantastic volunteers prepare different dish which are based on Eastern, vegetarian cuisine with a lot of flavours and history behind every dish. 
We are against food waste, so please tell us if you are coming, so we can prepare enough for everyone.

	   <p>Come as you are and Pay as you feel. Meals are offered on a ‘pay as you feel’ basis in order to ensure a proper meal to all, regardless of one’s situation. This means there are no set prices on any food at One Bowl. We do provide suggested donation amounts for our menu to help you understand the cost of “paying it forward” and how to help those who struggle with food insecurity. Everything you give over the suggested price, goes to help others and to continues One Bowl work.</p>
