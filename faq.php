   		<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
	   <p><b>Where is the nearest parking lot?</b><br>
		Whole area near Ansgardskirken has parking spots. You can park there for free. 
		<br><br>
		<b>Because of my allergies I would like to know where I can find information about the ingredients used for the dishes?</b>
		<br>
		Please contact our stuff before you come and they will prepare dish specially for you.
		<br><br>
		<b>Is One Bowl kid friendly?</b>
		<br>
		Everyone is welcome in One Bowl. Each week we make a kids friendly dish, in case your little one hasn’t grown up on curry or other unique spices.
		<br><br>
		<b>How much do I have to pay for the food?</b>
		<br>
		We work with pay-as-you-feel concept, because we believe in helping each other. You can pay as much as your budget allows you to. Every week we suggest the price which covers all the food expenses and everything above that price goes to the next person who can’t afford warm dinner. 
		<br><br>
		<b>What payment methods do you accept? </b>
		<br>
		We accept cash in Danish Kroner, credit cards and MobilePay. 
		<br><br>
		<b>Do I have to RSVP before I come?</b>
		<br>
		For each opening of One Bowl we create Facebook and MeetUp event where you always help us by RSVP, because we don’t like food waste, but it is not a requirement you so if you decide last minute to join us just come. 
		<br><br>
		<b>Do you take groups or birthday parties?</b>
		<br>
		One bowl is open for everyone so come and take as many friends as you can. If you are group more than 6 people, please write us an e-mail on info@onebowl.dk
		<br><br>
		<b>I can see that you are located in the church, are you affiliated with the Danish State Church?</b>
		<br>
		To make a difference and spread awareness about food insecurities we paired up with Ansgardskirken. But there is no religious agenda behind One Bowl. We want to welcome everyone. People all nationalities, backgrounds and religions. Just come as you are. </p>
